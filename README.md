## Notes from Lubanovic
### Why FastAPI?
* Performance
* Faster development
* Better code quality - type hinting and models
* Autogenerated documentation
* Pydantic for data definition and validation

Uvicorn is a webserver

### Requests
* Header
* Path
* Query
* Body

Can get data from all of these.

* response is JSON
* Pydantic type checks params if hinted
Page:

## Starlette
* handles the request parsing and response generation
* support for ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) = fast

## Concurrency
* distributed / parallel
* OS processes - python has multiprocessing module
* OS threads - threads of control within a single process
* FastAPI manages threads via threadpools for normal functions
* green threads
* don't need gather and run (asyncio)


## Chapter 5 Pydantic, Type Hints and Models
thing : str = 'hi'
function(args) -> type:

Pydantic models : stand out for validation

Can add extra validation:
Int
* gt
* lt
* ge
* le
* multiple_of
Str constr() - constrained string
* min_length
* max_length
* to_upper
* to_lower
* regex
Tuple, list, set
* min_items
* max items
```
class Creature(BaseModel):
    name: constr(min_length=2)
    country: str
    area: str
    description: str

```

Field(...,min_length=2) means required and no default
